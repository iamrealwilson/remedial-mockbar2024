The protected area covered a portion located in Municipality A of the Province I and a portion located in the City of Z of Province II. Maingat is the leader of Samahan ng Tagapag-ingat ng Karbungko (STK), a people's organization. He learned that a portion of the mountain located in the City of Z of Province II was extremely damaged when it was bulldozed and levelled to the ground, and several trees and plants were cut down and burned by workers of World Pleasure Resorts, Inc. (WPRI) for the construction of a hotel and golf course. Upon inquiry with the project site engineer if they had a permit for the project, Maingat was shown a copy of the Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) issued by the DENR-EMB, Regional Director (RD-DENR-EMB). Immediately, Maingat and STK filed a petition for the issuance of a writ of continuing mandamus against RD-DENR-EMB and WPRI with the RTC of Province I, a designated environmental court, as the RD-DENR-EMB negligently issued the ECC to WPRI.  On scrutiny of the petition, the court determined that the area where the alleged actionable neglect or omission subject of the petition took place in the City of Z of Province II, and therefore cognizable by the RTC of Province II. Thus, the court dismissed outright the petition for lack of jurisdiction. (2015 BAR QUESTION)  A.  Was the court correct in motu proprio dismissing the petition?"

    "text": "4.   Estrella was the registered owner of a huge parcel of land located in a remote part of their barrio in Benguet. However, when she visited the property after she took a long vacation abroad, she was surprised to see that her childhood friend, John, had established a vacation house on her property. Both Estrella and John were residents of the same barangay.  To recover possession, Estrella filed a complaint for ejectment with the Municipal Trial Court (MTC), alleging that she is the true owner of the land as evidenced by her certificate of title and tax declaration which showed the assessed value of the property as P21,000.00. On the other hand, John refuted Estrella’s claim of ownership and submitted in evidence a Deed of Absolute Sale  between him and Estrella. After the filing of John’s answer, the MTC observed that the real issue was one of ownership and not of possession. Hence, the MTC dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.  On appeal by Estrella to the Regional Trial Court (RTC), a full-blown trial was conducted as if the case was originally filed with it. The RTC reasoned that based on the assessed value of the property, it was the court of proper jurisdiction. Eventually, the RTC rendered a judgment declaring John as the owner of the land and, hence, entitled to the possession thereof. (2014 BAR QUESTION)  A.  Was the MTC correct in dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction? Why or why not?"

Instead of filing an answer to the complaint, Robert White filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground of lack of the appropriate board resolution from the Board of Directors of Goodfeather Corporation to show the authority of Al Pakino to represent the corporation and file the complaint in its behalf. The RTC granted the motion to dismiss and, accordingly it ordered the dismissal of the complaint. Al Pakino filed a motion for reconsideration which the RTC denied.  As nothing more could be done by Al Pakino before the RTC, he filed an appeal before the Court of Appeals (CA). Robert White moved for dismissal of the appeal on the ground that the same involved purely a question of law and should have been filed with the Supreme Court (SC). However, Al Pakino claimed that the appeal involved mixed questions of fact and law because there must be a factual determination if, indeed, Al Pakino was duly authorized by Goodfeather Corporation to file the complaint.

Still later,  Borrower obtained a P300,000.00 loan secured by a real estate mortgage on his land valued at P500,000.00. Borrower  defaulted  on  his  payments  when  the  loans  matured.

At the trial, Borrower's lawyer, while cross-examining Lender, successfully elicited an admission from the latter that the two promissory notes have been paid. Thereafter, Borrower's lawyer filed a motion to dismiss the case on the ground that as proven only P300,000.00 was the amount due to Lender and which claim is within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Trial Court. He further argued that lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter can be raised at any stage of the proceedings. Should the court dismiss the case? (2015 BAR QUESTION)"

Juliet invoking the provisions of the Rule on Violence Against Women and their Children filed with the RTC designated as a Family Court a petition for issuance of a Temporary Protection Order (TPO) against her husband, Romeo. The Family Court issued a 30-day TPO against Romeo. A day before the expiration of the TPO, Juliet filed a motion for extension. Romeo in his opposition raised, among others, the constitutionality of R.A. No. 9262 (The VAWC Law) arguing that the law authorizing the issuance of a TPO violates the equal protection and due process clauses of the 1987 Constitution. The Family Court judge, in granting the motion for extension of the TPO, declined to rule on the constitutionality of R.A. No. 9262. The Family Court judge reasoned that Family Courts are without jurisdiction to pass upon constitutional issues, being a special court of limited jurisdiction and R.A. No. 8369, the law creating the Family Courts, does not provide for such jurisdiction. Is the Family Court judge correct when he declined to resolve the constitutionality of R.A. No. 9262?

The Lender correctly applied the totality rule and the rule on joinder of causes of action because where the claims in all the causes of action are principally for recovery of money, the aggregate amount of the claim shall be the test of jurisdiction (Section 5 (d), Rule 2, Rules of Court). Here, the total amount of the claim is P500,000.00. Hence, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila has jurisdiction over the suit.

In one particularly exhilarating session with his girlfriend, Dario died. Within 180 days from Dario’s death, Yvonne gives birth in Manila to a baby boy. Irate relatives of Dario contemplate criminally charging Yvonne for adultery and they hire your law firm to handle the case.\n\nA) Is the contemplated criminal action a viable option to bring? (2013 BAR QUESTION)\n\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNO. Section 5 of Rule 110 provides that the crimes of adultery and concubinage shall not be prosecuted except upon complaint by the offended spouse. Since the offended party is already dead, then the criminal action for adultery as contemplated by offended party’s relatives is no longer viable.\n\nB) Is a civil action to impugn the paternity of the baby boy feasible, and if so, in what proceeding may such issue be determined? (2013 BAR QUESTION)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nYES, under Article 171 of the Family Code, the heirs of the husband may impugn the filiation of the child in the following cases:\n1)   If the husband should die before the expiration of the period fixed for bringing his action;\n2)   If he should die after the filing of the complaint, without having desisted therefrom; or\n3)   If the child was born after the death of the husband.\n\nSince Dario is already dead when the baby boy was born, his heirs have the right to impugn the filiation of the child.\n\nConsequently, the heirs may impugn the filiation either by a direct action to impugn such filiation or raise the same in a special proceeding for settlement of the estate of the decedent. In the said proceeding, the Probate court has the power to determine questions as to who are the heirs of the decedent (Reyes v. Ysip, et al., G.R. No. L-7516, May 12, 1955; Jimenez v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. 75773, April 17, 1990).\n\nIncidentally, the heirs can also submit the baby boy for DNA testing (Rules on DNA Evidence, A.M. No. 6-\n11-5-SC) or even blood-test in order to determine paternity and filiation.\n\nIn Jao v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. L-49162, July 28, 1987, the Supreme Court held that blood grouping tests are conclusive as to non-paternity, although inconclusive as to paternity. The fact that the blood type of the child is a possible product of the mother and alleged father does not conclusively prove that the child is born by such parents; but, if the blood type of the child is not the possible blood type when the blood of the mother and that of the alleged father are cross matched, then the child cannot possibly be that of the alleged father.\n\n"

He was bumped from behind by a Ford Expedition SUV driven by Horace who was observed using his cellular phone at the time of the collision. Both vehicles - more than 5 years old – no longer carried insurance other than the compulsory third party liability insurance. Gary suffered physical injuries while his Nissan Patrol sustained damage in excess of Php500,000.\n\nA) As counsel for Gary, describe the process you need to undertake starting from the point of the incident if Gary would proceed criminally against Horace, and identify the court with jurisdiction over the case. (2013 BAR QUESTION)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nAs counsel for Gary, I will first make him medically examined in order to ascertain the gravity and extent of the injuries he sustained from the accident. Second, I will secure a police report relative to the mishap. Third, I will ask him to execute his Sinumpaang Salaysay. Thereafter, I will use his Sinumpaang Salaysay or prepare a complaint affidavit and file the same in the Office of the City Prosecutor and later on to the\n\nappropriate MTC of Mandaluyong City for the crime of Reckless Imprudence resulting to physical injuries and damage to property (Sec. 1 and 15, Rule 110).\n\nB) If Gary chooses to file an independent civil action for damages, explain briefly this type of action: its legal basis; the different approaches in pursuing this type of action; the evidence you would need; and types of defenses you could expect. (2013 BAR QUESTION)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nAn independent civil action is an action which is entirely distinct and separate from the criminal action. Such  civil action  shall  proceed  independently  of  the  criminal  prosecution  and  shall  require  only  a preponderance of evidence. Section 3 of Rule 111 allows the filing of an independent civil action by the offended party based on Article 33 and 2176 of the New Civil Code.\n\nThe different approaches that the plaintiff can pursue in this type of action are, as follows:\n1)   File the independent civil action and prosecute the criminal case separately.\n2)   File the independent civil action without filing the criminal case.\n3)   File the criminal case without need of reserving the independent civil action.\n\nAside from the testimony of Gary, the pieces of evidence that would be required in an independent civil action are the medical report and certificate regarding the injuries sustained by Gary, hospital and medical bills including receipt of payments made, police report and proof of the extent of damage sustained by his car, and the affidavit of witnesses who saw Horace using his cellular phone at the time the incident happened.\n\nI will also present proof of employment of Gary such as his pay slip in order to prove that he was gainfully employed at the time of the mishap, and as a result of the injuries he suffered, he was not able to earn his usual income thereof. I will also present the attending Doctor of Gary to corroborate and authenticate the contents of the medical report and abstract thereof. The evidence required to hold defendant Horace liable is only preponderance of evidence.\n\nThe types of defenses that may be raised against this action are fortuitous event, force majeure or acts of God. The defendant can also invoke contributory negligence as partial defense. Moreover, the defendant can raise the usual defenses that the: (a) plaintiff will be entitled to double compensation or recovery, and (b) defendant will be constrained to litigate twice and therefore suffer the cost of litigation twice.\n\n"

Samuel was also indicted under the amended information. Before Samuel was arraigned, he moved to quash the amended information on the ground that the officer who filed the same had no authority to do so. Resolve the motion to quash with reasons. (2009 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nThe motion to quash filed by Samuel should be granted.\n\nThere is no showing that the special prosecutor was duly authorized or deputized to prosecute Samuel. Under R.A.

Desierto, 529 SCRA 720 [2007])\n\nAbsent a clear delegation of authority from the Ombudsman to the Special Prosecutor to file the information, the latter would have no authority to file the same.

An Information for plunder was filed with the Sandiganbayan against the provincial officials except for the treasurer who was granted immunity when he agreed to cooperate with the Ombudsman in the prosecution of the case. Immediately, the governor filed with the Sandiganbayan a petition for certiorari against the Ombudsman claiming there was grave abuse of discretion in excluding the treasurer from the Information. (2015\nBAR QUESTION)\n\nA) Was the remedy taken by the governor correct? SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nNo, the remedy taken by the Governor is not correct. The petition for certiorari is a remedy that is only\navailable when there is no plain, speedy and adequate remedy under the ordinary course of law; hence, the Governor should have filed a Motion for Reconsideration. Besides, there is no showing that the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in granting immunity to the treasurer who agreed to cooperate in the prosecution of the case.\n\nB) Will the writ of mandamus lie to compel the Ombudsman to include the treasurer in the\nInformation? SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nNo. Mandamus will not lie to compel the Ombudsman to include the treasurer in the Information. In matters involving the exercise of judgment and discretion, mandamus may only be resorted to in order to\n\ncompel respondent tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person to take action, but it cannot be used to direct the manner or the particular way discretion is to be exercised, or to compel the retraction or reversal of an action already taken in the exercise of judgment or discretion (Ampatuan, Jr. v. Secretary De Lima, G.R. No. 197291, April 3, 2013).\n\nEvidently, the Ombudsman’s act of granting the treasurer immunity from prosecution under such terms and conditions as it may deter mine (Section 17, R.A. 6770) is a discretionary duty that may not be compelled by the extraordinary writ of mandamus.\n\nC) Can the Special Prosecutor move for the discharge of the budget officer to corroborate the testimony of the treasurer in the course of presenting its evidence?\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNo. The special Prosecutor cannot move for the discharge of the budget officer to become a State witness since his testimony is only corroborative to the testimony of the treasurer. Under Section 17, Rule 119, the Court upon motion of the prosecution before resting its case, may direct one or more of the accused to be discharged with their consent so that they may be witnesses for the State, provided the following requisites are satisfied: (a) there is absolute necessity for the testimony of the accused whose discharge is requested; (b) there is no other direct evidence available for the proper prosecution of the offense committed, except the testimony of said accused; (c) the testimony of said accused can be substantially corroborated in its material points; (d) said accused does not appear to be the most guilty; and (e) said accused has not at any time been convicted of any offense involving moral turpitude. Absolute necessity exists for the testimony of an accused sought to be discharged when he or she alone has knowledge of the crime. In more concrete terms, necessity is not present when the testimony would simply corroborate or otherwise strengthen the prosecution’s evidence. The requirement of absolute necessity for the testimony of a state witness depends on the circumstances of each case regardless of the number of the participating conspirators (Manuel J. Jimenez, Jr., v. People of the Philippines, G.R. No. 209195, September 17, 2014).\n\nALTERNATIVE ANSWER:\n\nNo, the special Prosecutor cannot move for the discharge of the budget officer to become a State witness. The Office of the Special Prosecutor is merely a component of the Office of the Ombudsman and may only act under the supervision and control, and upon authority of the Ombudsman (Uy v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No 105965 70, March 20, 2001). Accordingly, in the absence of any express delegation and authority from the Ombudsman, the Special Prosecutor does not have the power to move for the discharge of the budget officer to corroborate the testimony of the treasurer in the course of presenting its evidence (Section\n11 (3), R.A. 6770).\n\nC.Prosecution of civil action (Rule 111)\n\n"

Matigas, there is no public officer charged in the information.\n\nIs the Motion to Quash legally tenable? (2014 BAR QUESTION)\n\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNo. The Motion to quash is not legally tenable. While it is true that by reason of the death of Gov. Matigas, there is no longer any public officer with whom he can be charged for violation of R.A. 3019, it does not mean, however, that the allegation of conspiracy between them can no longer be proved or that their alleged conspiracy is already expunged. The only thing extinguished by the death of Gov. Matigas is his criminal liability. His death did not extinguish the crime nor did it remove the basis of the charge of conspiracy between him and Carpintero. The requirement before a private person may be indicated for violation of Section 3(g) of R.A. 3019, among others, is that such private person must be alleged to have acted in conspiracy with a public officer. The law, however, does not require that such person must, in all instances, be indicated together with the public officer. Indeed, it is not necessary to join all alleged co-conspirators in an indictment for conspiracy (People of the Philippines v. Henry T. Go, G.R. No. 168539, March 25, 2014).\n\n"

When Faith found out about the second marriage of Solomon and Hope, she filed a criminal case for bigamy before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila sometime in 2011. Meanwhile, Solomon filed a petition for declaration of nullity of his first marriage with Faith in 2012, while the case for bigamy before the RTC of Manila is ongoing. Subsequently, Solomon filed a motion to suspend the proceedings in the bigamy case on the ground of prejudicial question. He asserts that the proceedings in the criminal case should be suspended because if his first marriage with Faith will be declared null and void, it will have the effect of exculpating him from the crime of bigamy. Decide. (2014 BAR QUESTION)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nThe motion filed by Solomon should be denied. The elements of prejudicial question are: (1) the previous instituted civil action involves an issue similar or intimately related to the issue determines the subsequent criminal action; and (2) the resolution of such issue determines whether or not the criminal action may proceed. In order for a prejudicial question to exist, the civil action must precede the filing of the criminal action (Dreamwork Construction, Inc. v. Janiola, G.R. No. 184861, June 30, 2009). Since the criminal case for bigamy was filed ahead of the civil action for declaration of nullity of marriage, there is no prejudicial question. At any rate, the outcome of the civil case for annulment has no bearing upon the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused in the criminal case for bigamy because the accused has already committed the crime of bigamy when he contracted the second marriage without the first marriage having being declared null and void. Otherwise stated, he who contracts marriage during the subsistence of a previously contracted marriage runs the risk of being prosecuted for bigamy.\n\n"

Lawyer L, who witnessed the incident, offered his legal services to V.\n\n\nV, who suffered physical injuries including a fractured wrist bone, underwent surgery to screw a metal plate to his wrist bone. On complaint of V, a criminal case for Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Serious Physical Injuries was filed against X before the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Sta. Maria. Atty. L, the private prosecutor, did not reserve the filing of a separate civil action.\n\nV subsequently filed a complaint for Damages against X and Y before the Regional Trial Court of Pangasinan in Urdaneta where he resides. In his \"Certification against Forum Shopping” V made no mention of the pendency of the, criminal case in Sta. Maria. (2010 BAR QUESTION)\n\nA) Is V guilty of forum shopping? SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nNo, V is not 'guilty of forum shopping because the case In Sta. Maria, Bulacan, Is a criminal action rued in the name of the People of the Philippines, where civil liability arising from the crime is deemed also instituted therewith; whereas the case rued in Urdaneta, Pangasinan, is a civil action for quasi-delict in, the name of V and against both X and Y for all damages caused by X and Y to V, which may be beyond the jurisdiction of MTC. Hence, the tests of forum shopping, which is res adjudicata or litis pendencia, do not obtain here.\n\nMoreover, substantive law (Art. 33 Civil Code) and Sec. 3, Rule III, Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, expressly authorize the filing. Such, action for damages is entirely separate and distinct from the criminal action.\n\nB) Instead of filing an Answer, X and Y move to dismiss the complaint for damages on the ground of litis pendentia. Is the motion meritorious? Explain.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNo, the motion' to dismiss base on alleged litis pendencia is without merit because there is no identity of parties and subject matter in the two cases. Besides, Art. 33 of the Civil Code and Rule III, Sec. 3 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure authorize the separate civil action for damages arising from physical injuries to proceed independently.\n\nC) Suppose only X was named as defendant in the complaint for damages, may he move for the dismissal of the complaint for failure of V to implead Y as an indispensable party?\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNo, X may not move for dismissal of the civil action for damages on the contention that Y is an indispensable party who should be impleaded. Y is not an indispensable party but only a necessary party. Besides, non-joinder and' misjoinder of parties is not a ground for dismissal of actions (Rule 3, Sec. 11, Rules of Court.)\n\nD) X moved for the suspension of the proceedings in the criminal case to await the decision in the civil case. For his part. Y moved for the suspension of the civil case to await the decision in the criminal case. Which of them is correct? Explain.\n\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNeither of them is correct. Both substantive law (Art.33 of the Civil Code) and procedural law (Rule III, Sec.\n3, and Rules of Criminal Procedure) provide for the two actions to proceed independently of each other, therefore, no suspension of action is authorized.\n\n"

They were terminated on the ground that they failed to meet the prescribed production quota at least four (4) times. The NLRC decision was assailed in a special civil action under Rule 65 before the Court of Appeals (CA). In the verification and certification against forum shopping, only Toto signed the verification and certification, while Atty. Arman signed for Nelson. Empire filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of defective verification and certification. Decide with reasons. (2016 BAR QUESTION)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nThe motion to dismiss should be denied, because there is substantial compliance of the requirements of the rules. Verification is not a jurisdictional but merely a formal requirement which the court may motu proprio direct a party to comply with or correct, as the case may be. On the other hand, regarding the certificate of non-forum shopping, the general rule is that all the petitioners or plaintiffs in a case should sign it. However, the Supreme Court has time and again stressed that the rules on forum shopping, which were designed to promote the orderly administration of justice, do not interdict substantial compliance with its provisions under justifiable circumstances. As ruled by the Court, the signature of any of the principal petitioners or principal parties, would constitute a substantial compliance with the rule on verification and certification of non-forum shopping. And should there exist a commonality of interest among the parties, or where the parties filed the case as a collective, raising only one common cause of action or presenting a common defense, then the signature of one of the petitioners or complainants, acting as representative, is sufficient compliance (Irene Marcos-Araneta v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 154096, August\n22, 2008). Evidently, since there is a commonality of interest among Tailors Toto, Nelson and Yenyen, there is substantial compliance with the rules on verification and certification against forum shopping, when Toto signed the verification and certification, and Atty. Arman signed the same for Nelson.\n\nANOTHER SUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nThe motion to dismiss should be granted. The verification and certification of non-forum shopping were not signed by all the petitioners. There was no showing that Toto nor Atty. Arman were duly authorized by the other petitioners through a special power of attorney to sign on their behalf; hence, the motion to dismiss should be granted.\n\nD.   Preliminary Investigation\n\n"

Sensing that the occupants of the vehicle were up to no good, he darted into a corner and ran. The occupants of the vehicle- elements from the Western Police District - gave chase and apprehended him.\n\nThe police apprehended Cicero, frisked him and found a sachet of 0.09 gram of shabu tucked in his waist and a Swiss knife in his secret pocket, and detained him thereafter. Is the arrest and body-search legal? (2010 BAR QUESTION)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nThe arrest and body-search was legal. Cicero appears to be alone \"walking down a dark alley\" and at midnight. There appears probable cause for the policemen to check him, especially when he darted into a corner (presumably also dark) and run under such circumstance. Although the arrest came after the body- search where Cicero was found with shabu and a Swiss knife, the body search is legal under the \"Terry search\" rule or the \"stop and frisk\" rule. And because the mere possession, with animus, of dangerous drug (the shabu) is a violation of the law (Rep. Act 9165), the suspect is in a continuing state of committing a crime while he is illegally possessing the dangerous drug, thus making the arrest tantamount to an arrest in flagrante: so the arrest is legal and correspondingly, the search and seizure of the shabu and the concealed knife may be regarded as incident to a lawful arrest.\n\nALTERNATIVE ANSWER:\n\nNo. The arrest and the body-search were not legal. In this case, Cicero did not run because the occupants of the vehicle identified themselves as police officers. He darted into the corner and ran upon the belief that the Occupants of the vehicle were up to no good. Cicero's act of running does not show any reasonable ground to believe that a crime has been committed or is about to be committed for the police officers to apprehend him and conduct body search. Hence, the arrest was illegal as it does not fall under any of the circumstances for a valid warrantless arrest provided in Sec. 5 of Rule 113 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\n"

State your reason for each ground. (2015 BAR QUESTION)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNo, the warrant of arrest may not be quashed based on the grounds cited by Rapido’s counsel. In the issuance of a warrant of arrest, the mandate of the Constitution is for the judge to personally determine the existence of probable cause. The words “personal determination,” was interpreted by the Supreme Court in Soliven v. Makasiar, (G.R. No. 82585, November 14, 1988, 167 SCRA 393, 406), as the exclusive and personal responsibility of the issuing judge to satisfy himself, as to the existence of probable cause. What the law requires as personal determination on the part of a judge is that he should not rely solely on the report of the investigating prosecutor. Thus, personal examination of the complainant and his witnesses is, thus, not mandatory and indispensable in the determination of probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest (People v. Joseph “Jojo” Grey, G.R. No. 10109, July 26, 2010).

As soon as Hercules came near, the police officer frisked him but the latter found no contraband. The police officer told Hercules to get inside the police station. Inside the police station, Hercules asked the police officer, \"Sir, may problema po ba?\" Instead of replying, the police officer locked up Hercules inside the police station jail. (2015 BAR QUESTION)\n\nA) What is the remedy available to Hercules to secure his immediate release from detention? SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nThe remedy available to Hercules is to file a petition for habeas corpus questioning the illegality of his warrantless arrest. The writ of habeas corpus shall extend to all cases of illegal confinement or detention by which any person is deprived of his liberty (Section 1, Rule 102, Rules of Court).\n\nALTERNATIVE ANSWER:\n\nHercules may also apply for bail. Under Section 17 (c), Rule 114 of the Rules of Court, any person in custody who is not yet charged in court may apply for bail with any court in the province, city or municipality where he is held.\n\nB) If Hercules filed with the Ombudsman a complaint for warrantless search, as counsel for the police officer, what defense will you raise for the dismissal of the complaint?\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nAs counsel of the policemen, I will raise the defense of presumption of  regularity in the performance of duty. I can also raise the defense that the police officer has the duty to search Hercules under the “Stop and Frisk” rule. A stop-and-frisk situation must precede a warrantless arrest, be limited to the person’s outer clothing, and should be grounded upon a genuine reason, in the light of the police office and surrounding conditions, to warrant the belief that detained has weapons concealed about him. (Valdez v. People, G.R. No. 170180, November 23, 2007).\n\nThe “stop and frisk” search should be used when dealing rapidly unfolding and potentially criminal situation in the city streets where unarguably there is no time to secure a search warrant. “Stop and frisk” searches (sometimes referred to as Terry searches) necessary for law enforcement, that is, law enforcers should be given the legal arsenal to prevent the commission of offenses. This should be balanced, however, with the need to protect the privacy of citizens in accordance with Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution (People of the Philippines v. Victor Cogaed, G.R. No. 200334, July 30, 2014). In addition, I may also assert the defense that the complaint for warrantless search charges no criminal offense. The conduct of a warrantless search is not a criminal act, for it is not penalized under the Revised Penal Code or any other special laws.\n\nALTERNATIVE ANSWER:\n\nAs counsel for the police officer, I will argue that the Ombudsman has no jurisdiction over the complaint filed by Hercules. While the Ombudsman has disciplinary authority over officials and members of the PNP concurrently with NAPOLCOM and PNP, the Memorandum of Agreement executed by and among the Ombudsman, PNP and NAPOLCOM on September 12, 2012 specifies the administrative cases that are within the primary jurisdiction of the Ombudsman. Since the complaint filed against my client is not among those administrative cases under the primary jurisdiction of the Ombudsman, the complaint should necessarily be dismissed.\n\nC) If Hercules opts to file a civil action against the police officer, will he have a cause of action? SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nYes. Hercules has a cause of action to file a civil action against the police officer under Article 32 (4) in\nrelation to Article 2219 (6) and (10) of the New Civil Code, which provides that a public officer may be liable for damages when the right to be secure in one’s person, house, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures is impaired. The indemnity includes moral damages. Exemplary damages may also be adjudicated (Galvante v. Casimiro, G.R. No. 162808, April 22, 2008).\n\n"

Under Section 5, Rule 113 a warrantless arrest is allowed when an offense has just been committed and the peace officer has probable cause to believe, based on his personal knowledge of facts or circumstances, that the person to be arrested has committed it. A policeman approaches you for advice and asks you how he will execute a warrantless arrest against a murderer who escaped after killing a person. The policeman arrived two (2) hours after the killing and a certain Max was allegedly the killer per information given by a witness. He asks you to clarify the following: (2016\nBAR QUESTION)\n\nA) How long after the commission of the crime can he still execute the warrantless arrest? SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nIn executing a warrantless arrest under Section 5, Rule 113, the Supreme Court held that the requirement\nthat an offense has just been committed means that there must be a large measure of immediacy between the time the offense was committed and the time of the arrest (Joey M. Pestilos v. Moreno Generoso, G.R. No.\n182601, November 10, 2014). If there was an appreciable lapse of time between the arrest and the commission of the crime, a warrant of arrest must be secured. In any case, personal knowledge by the arresting officer is an indispensable requirement to the validity of a valid warrantless arrest. The exact period varies on a case to case basis. In People v. Gerente (G.R. Nos. 95847-48, March 10, 1993), the Supreme Court ruled that a warrantless arrest was validly executed upon therein accused three (3) hours after the commission of the crime. In People v. Tonog, Jr. (G.R. No. 94533. February 4, 1992), the Supreme Court likewise upheld the valid warrantless arrest which was executed on the same day as the commission of the crime. However, in People v. Del Rosario (G.R. No. 127755. April 14, 1999, 365 Phil. 292), the Supreme Court held that the warrantless arrest effected a day after the commission of the crime is invalid. In Go v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 101837, February 11, 1992), Supreme Court also declared invalid a warrantless arrest effected 6 days after the commission of the crime.\n\nB) What does \"personal knowledge of the facts and circumstances that the person to be arrested committed it\" mean?\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nThe phrase “personal knowledge of the facts and circumstances that the person to be arrested committed it” means that matters in relation to the supposed commission of the crime were within the actual perception, personal evaluation or observation of the police officer at the scene of the crime. Thus, even though the police officer has not seen someone actually fleeing, he could still make a warrantless arrest if, based on his personal evaluation of the circumstances at the scene of the crime, he could determine the existence of probable cause that the person sought to be arrested has committed the crime; however, the determination of probable cause and the gathering of facts or circumstances should be made immediately after the commission of the crime in order to comply with the element of immediacy.\n\nThe arresting officer’s determination of probable cause under Section 5(b), Rule 113 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure is based on his personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person sought to be arrested has committed the crime. These facts or circumstances pertain to actual facts or raw evidence, i.e., supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to create the probable cause of guilt of the person to be arrested. A reasonable suspicion therefore must be founded on probable cause, coupled with good faith on the part of the peace officers making the arrest. The probable cause to justify warrantless arrest ordinarily signifies a reasonable ground of suspicion supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a cautious man to believe that the person accused is guilty of the offense with which he is charged, or an actual belief or reasonable ground of suspicion, based on actual facts (Joey M. Pestilos v. Moreno Generoso, G.R. No. 182601, November 10, 2014).\n\n"

No Motion for Reconsideration was filed from the denial of the Petition for Bail. During the reception of the evidence of the accused, the accused reiterated his petition for bail on the ground that the witnesses so far presented by the accused had shown that no qualifying aggravating circumstance attended the killing. The court denied the petition on the grounds that it had already ruled that: (i) the evidence of guilt is strong; (ii) the resolution for the Petition for Bail is solely based on the evidence presented by the prosecution; and (iii) no Motion for Reconsideration was filed from the denial of the Petition for Bail. (2014 BAR QUESTION)\n\nA) If you are the Judge, how will you resolve the incident? SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nIf I were the Judge, I would grant the second Petition for Bail. Under Section 7, Rule 114, Rules of Court, no person charged with a capital offense, or an offense punishable by reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment, shall be admitted to bail when evidence of guilt is strong, regardless of the stage of the criminal prosecution. In this case, the evidence of guilt for the crime of murder is not strong, as shown by the prosecution’s failure to prove the circumstance that will qualify the crime to, and consequently convict the accused of, murder. Accordingly, the accused should be allowed to post bail because the evidence of\n\nhis guilt is no strong (Sec. 13, Art. III, 1987 Constitution). Besides, it is settled that an Order granting bail is merely interlocutory which cannot attain finality (Pobre v. People, G. R. No. 141805, July 8, 2015).\n\nB) Suppose the accused is convicted of the crime of homicide and the accused filed a Notice of\nAppeal, is he entitled to bail? SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nYES. The accused is entitled to bail subject to the discretion of the Court. Under Section 5, Rule 114, Rules of Court, the appellate Court may allow him to post bail because the Trial Court in convicting him, changed the nature of the offense from non- bailable to bailable. Be that as it may, the denial of bail pending appeal is a matter of wise discretion since after conviction by the trial court, the presumption of innocence terminates and, accordingly, the constitutional right to bail ends.

    "text": "29. A was charged before the Sandiganbayan with a crime of plunder, a non- bailable offense, where the court had already issued a warrant for his arrest. Without A being arrested, his lawyer filed a Motion to Quash Arrest Warrant and to Fix Bail, arguing that the allegations in the information did not charge the  crime of plunder but a crime of malversation, a bailable offense. The court denied the motion on the ground that it had not yet acquire jurisdiction over the person of the accused and that the accused should be under the custody of the court since the crime charged was non-bailable. The accused’s lawyer counter- argued that the court can rule on the motion even if the accused was at-large because it had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case. According to said lawyer, there was no need for the accused to be under the custody of the court because what was filed was a Motion to Quash Arrest and to Fix Bail not a Petition for Bail. (2014\nBAR QUESTION)\n\nA) If you are the Sandiganbayan, how will you rule on the motion? SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nI will grant the Motion to quash the warrant of arrest but I will deny the Motion to fix bail. A motion to fix bail is essentially an application for bail (People v. Bucalon, G.R. No. 176933, October 2, 2009). Relative thereto, bail is the security for the release of the person in the custody of the law (Sec. 1, Rule 114). The Rules use the word “custody” to signify that bail is only available for someone who is under the custody of the law (Peter Paul Dimatulac v. Hon. Sesinando Villon, G.R. No. 127107, October 12, 1998). Hence, A cannot seek any judicial relief if he does not submit his person to the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.\n\nOn the other hand, the Sandiganbayan may grant the Motion to quash the warrant of arrest. It is well settled that adjudication of a motion to quash a warrant of arrest requires neither jurisdiction over the person of the accused nor custody of law over the body of the accused. Otherwise stated, an accused can invoke the processes of the court even if he is not in the custody of the law (Jose C. Miranda v. Virgilio M. Tuliao, G.R. No. 158763, March 31, 2006). Thus, Sandiganbayan may grant the Motion to quash the warrant of arrest.\n\nB) If the Sandiganbayan denies the motion, what judicial remedy should the accused undertake? SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nThe accused may file a Motion for Reconsideration. If the same is denied, the accused may resort to a\nPetition for Certiorari under Rule 65 directly to the Supreme Court.\n\n"

PO 1 Remus and P02 Romulus proceeded to the condo unit identified by Paz. PO 1 Remus knocked at the door and when a man opened the door, POI Remus and his companions introduced themselves as police officers. The man readily identified himself as Oasis Jung and gestured to them to come in. Inside, the police officers saw a young lady with her nose bleeding and face swollen. Asked by P02 Romulus what happened, the lady responded that she was beaten up by Oasis Jung. The police officers arrested Oasis Jung and brought him and the young lady back to the police station. PO1 Remus took the young lady's statement who identified herself as AA. She narrated that she is a sixteen-year-old high school student; that previous to the incident, she had sexual intercourse with Oasis Jung at least five times on different occasions and she was paid P5,000.00 each time and it was the first time that Oasis Jung physically hurt her. P02\nRomulus detained Oasis Jung at the station's jail. After the inquest proceeding, the public prosecutor filed an information for Violation of R.A. No. 9262 (Anti-VAWC Law) for physical violence and five separate informations for violation of R.A. No. 7610 (The Child Abuse Law). Oasis Jung's lawyer filed a motion to be admitted to bail but the court issued an order that approval of his bail bond shall be made only after his arraignment. (2015 BAR QUESTION)\n\nA) Did the court properly impose that bail condition? SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nNo. The court did not properly impose the bail condition. The Rules of Criminal Procedure do not require\nthe arraignment of the accused as a prerequisite to the conduct of the bail hearing. A person is allowed to file a petition for bail as soon as he is deprived of his liberty by virtue of his arrest or voluntary surrender. An accused need not wait for his arraignment before filing the petition for bail (Serapio v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 149116, January 28, 2003).\n\nMoreover, the condition that the approval of bail bonds shall be made only after arraignment would place the accused in a position where he has to choose between: (1) filing a motion to quash (the Information) and thus delay his released on bail because until his motion to quash can be resolved, his arraignment cannot be held; and (2) foregoing the filing of a motion to quash (the Information) so that he can be arraigned at once and thereafter be released on bail (Lavides v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 129670, February 1,\n2000).\n\nB) Before arraignment, Oasis Jung's lawyer moved to quash the other four separate informations for violation of the child abuse law invoking the single larceny rule. Should the motion to quash be granted?\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNo. The Court should not grant the motion to quash, because the “single larceny rule” does not find application where the charges involve violations of R.A. 9262 (The VAWC Law) and R.A. No. 7610 (The Child Abuse Law), considering that each criminal act is based on a different criminal impulse and intent.\n\n\nIn Santiago v. Garchitorena (G.R. No. 109266 December 2, 1993), the Supreme Court explained that the “Single Larceny doctrine” applies only to crimes committed delito continuado, which exists if there should be a plurality of acts performed during a period of time; unity of penal provision violated; and unity of criminal intent or purpose, which means that two or more violations of the same penal provisions are united in one and same instant or resolution leading to the perpetration of the same criminal purpose or aim. The said rule applies in theft cases, where the taking of several things, whether belonging to the same or different owners, at the same time and place constitutes but one larceny (Santiago v. Garchitorena, G.R. No. 109266, December 2, 1993).\n\n[Note: The Committee respectfully recommends that the examinees be given full credit to any answer provided to the question because the single larceny rule is not included in the 2015 BAR Examination Syllabus in Remedial Law).\n\nC) After his release from detention on bail, can Oasis Jung still question the validity of his arrest? SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nYes. Oasis Jung can still question the validity of his arrest even after his release from detention on bail.\nUnder Section 26, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court, an application for or admission to bail shall not bar the accused from challenging the validity of his arrest or the legality of the warrant issued therefor, or from assailing the regularity or questioning the absence of a preliminary investigation of the charge against him, provided that he raises them before entering his plea.\n\n"

May the Prosecution assail the acquittal without infringing the constitutional guarantee against\ndouble jeopardy in favor of Juancho? Explain your answer. (2017 BAR QUESTION)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nYes, the Prosecution may assail the acquittal without infringing upon the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy.\n\nUnder the Rules of Criminal Procedure, a requirement for a first jeopardy to attach is that there must have been a valid plea by the accused.

What ground or grounds can he raise in moving for the quashal of the information? Explain. (2016 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nThe accused may move to quash the information based on any of the following grounds: (a) That the facts charged do not constitute an offense; (b) That it does not conform substantially to the prescribed form; and (c) That more than one offense is charged except when a single punishment for various offenses is prescribed by law (Section 3 Rule 117, Rules of Criminal Procedure).\n\nIn People v. dela Cruz (G.R. Nos. 135554-56, June 21, 2002, 383 SCRA 410); the Supreme Court ruled that the phrase “either by raping her or committing acts of lasciviousness” does not constitute an offense since it does not cite which among the numerous sections or subsections of R.A. No. 7610 has been violated by accused-appellant. Moreover, it does not state the acts and omissions constituting the offense, or any special or aggravating circumstances attending the same, as required under the rules of criminal procedure.

When Boy Maton was searched immediately after the arrest, the officer found and recovered 10 sachets of shabu neatly tucked in the inner linings of the clutch bag. At the time of his arrest, Boy Maton was watching a basketball game being played in the town plaza, and he was cheering for his favorite team. He was subsequently charged with illegal possession of dangerous drugs, and he entered a plea of not guilty when he was arraigned.\n\nDuring the trial, Boy Maton moved for the dismissal of the information on the ground that the facts revealed that he had been illegally arrested. He further moved for the suppression of the evidence confiscated from him as being the consequence of the illegal arrest, hence, the fruit of the poisonous tree.\n\nThe trial court, in denying the motions of Boy Maton, explained that at the time the motions were filed Boy Maton had already waived the right to raise the issue of the legality of the arrest. The trial court observed that, pursuant to the Rules of Court, Boy Maton, as the accused, should have assailed the validity of the arrest before entering his plea to the information. Hence, the trial court opined that any adverse consequence of the alleged illegal arrest had also been equally waived.\n\nComment on the ruling of the trial court. (2017 BAR QUESTION) SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nThe ruling of the court denying the motion for dismissal of the information on the ground of illegal arrest is proper.\n\nUnder the Rules of Criminal Procedure, the accused’s failure to file a motion to quash before plea is a\nwaiver of the objection to lack of personal jurisdiction or of the objection to an illegal arrest. [S9 R117]\n\nHere Boy Maton entered a plea without filing a motion to quash on the ground of lack of personal jurisdiction. Hence he is deemed to have waived the ground of illegal arrest which is subsumed under lack of personal jurisdiction.\n\nHowever, the ruling denying the motion to suppress evidence is not correct.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that a waiver of an illegal, warrantless arrest does not carry with it a waiver of the inadmissibility of evidence seized during an illegal warrantless arrest. [People v. Racho, 3 Aug 2010]. A waiver of an illegal arrest is not a waiver of an illegal search. [Villanueva v. People, 17 Nov 2014, Sereno, C.J.] The Constitution provides that evidence seized in violation of the right against illegal search is inadmissible in evidence.\n\nHence the evidence seized was by virtue of an illegal search since the arrest was illegal.

What remedy would you undertake to address the situation and what forum would you use to invoke this relief? (2013 BAR QUESTION)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nSection 7, Rule 119 provides, if the public attorney assigned to defend a person charged with a crime knows that the latter is preventively detained, either because he is charged with bailable crime but has no means to post bail, or is charged with a non-bailable crime, or, is serving a term of imprisonment in any penal institution, it shall be his duty to do the following:\n1)   Shall promptly undertake to obtain the presence of the prisoner for trial or cause a notice to be served on the person having custody of the prisoner requiring such person to so advise the prisoner of his right to demand trial.\n2)   Upon receipt of that notice, the custodian of the prisoner shall promptly advise the prisoner of the charge and of his right to demand trial. If at any time thereafter the prisoner informs his custodian that he demands such trial, the latter shall cause notice to that effect to send promptly to the public attorney.\n\nMoreover, Section 1 (e), Rule 116 provides, when the accused is under preventive detention, his case shall be raffled and its records transmitted to the judge to whom the case was raffled within three (3) days from the filing of the information or complaint. The accused shall be arraigned within ten (10) days from the date of the raffle.

If the same is granted, then I will file a demurrer to evidence within ten (10) days from notice on the ground of insufficiency of evidence of the prosecution (Sec. 23, Rule 119).\n\nIn People v. De Guzman, G.R. No. 186498, March 26, 2010, the Supreme Court held that in prosecution for violation of the dangerous Drugs Act, the existence of the dangerous drug is a condition sine qua non for conviction. The dangerous drug is the very corpus delicti of the crime. The identity of the prohibited drug must be established with moral certainty. Apart from the showing that the elements of possession or sale are present, the fact that the substance illegally possessed and sold in the first place is the same substance offered in court as exhibit must likewise be established with the same degree of certitude as that needed to sustain a guilty verdict. The corpus delicti should be identified with unwavering exactitude.\n\nSimilarly, in People v. Sitco, G.R. No. 178202, May 14, 2010, the High Court held that in prosecutions involving narcotics and other illegal substances, the substance itself constitute part of the corpus delicti of the offense and the fact of its existence is vital to sustain a judgment of conviction beyond reasonable doubt. Of chief concern in drug cases then is the requirement that the prosecution prove that what was seized by police officers is the same item presented in court. This identification must be established with moral certainty and is a function of the rule of chain of custody. The chain of custody requirement is essential to ensure that doubts regarding the identity of the evidence are removed through the monitoring and tracking of the movements of the seized drugs from the accused, to the police, to the forensic chemist, and finally to the court.\n\n"

Before the said date, Pedro died. The accused moved to expunge Pedro's testimony on the ground that it violates his right of confrontation and the right to cross-examine the witness. The prosecution opposed the motion and asked that Pedro's testimony on direct examination be admitted as evidence. Is the motion meritorious? Explain. (2016 BAR QUESTION)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nThe Motion is meritorious. The cross-examination of a witness is an absolute right, not a mere privilege, of the party against whom he is called. With regard to the accused, it is a right guaranteed by the fundamental law as part of due process. Article III, Sec. 14, par. (2), of the 1987 Constitution specifically mandates that “the accused shall enjoy the right to meet the witnesses face to face,” and Rule 115, Sec. 1, par. (f), of the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure enjoins that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall be entitled to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him at the trial. Accordingly, the testimony of a witness given on direct examination should be stricken off the record where there was no adequate opportunity for cross-examination (People v. Fernando Monjey Rosario, G.R. No. 146689, September 27, 2002).\n\n\nIn People v. Manchetti (G.R. No. L-48883, August 6, 1980), the Supreme Court also held that if a party is deprived of the opportunity of cross examination without fault on his part, as in the case of the illness and death of a witness after direct examination, he is entitled to have the direct testimony stricken from the records. Since the accused was deprived of an opportunity to cross examine the witness without fault on his part, the motion to expunge is meritorious.\n\nANOTHER SUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nThe Motion is not meritorious. The right of a party to confront and cross-examine opposing witnesses in a judicial litigation is a personal one which may be waived, expressly or impliedly, by conduct amounting to a renunciation of the right of cross-examination. Where a party has had the opportunity to cross-examine a witness but failed to avail himself of it, he necessarily forfeits the right to cross-examine and the testimony given on direct examination of the witness will be received or allowed to remain in the record. The conduct of a party which may be construed as an implied waiver of the right to cross-examine may take various forms. The common basic principle underlying the application of the rule on implied waiver is that the party was given the opportunity to confront and cross-examine an opposing witness but failed to take advantage of it for reasons attributable to himself alone (People of the Philippines v. Adones Abatayao, G.R. No.\n139456, July 7, 2004). Under the Doctrine of incomplete testimony, the direct testimony of a witness who dies before conclusion of the cross-examination can be stricken only insofar as not covered by the cross- examination (Curtice v. West, 2 NYS 507,50 Hun 47, affirmed 24 N.E. 1099, 121 N.Y. 696), and that a referee has no power to strike the examination of a witness on his failure to appear for cross-examination where a good excuse is given (People v. Hon. Alberto V. Seneris, G.R. No. L-48883 August 6, 1980). At any rate, the accused may be deemed to have waived his right to confront and cross-examine the witness when he asked the postponements of the hearing for several times; therefore, the direct testimony of a witness who died before the conclusion of the cross-examination should not be expunged from the records.\n\nK.Judgment (Rule 120)\n\nL.

On October 5, 2015, Jaime filed a Motion for New Trial on the ground that errors of law and irregularities prejudicial to his rights were committed during his trial. On October 7, 2015, the private prosecutor, with the conformity of the public prosecutor, filed an Opposition to Jaime's motion. On October 9, 2015, the court granted Jaime's motion. On October 12, 2015, the public prosecutor filed a motion for reconsideration. The court issued an Order dated October 16, 2015 denying the public prosecutor's motion for reconsideration. The public prosecutor received his copy of the order of denial on October 20, 2015 while the private prosecutor received his copy on October 26, 2015. (2015 BAR QUESTION)\n\nA) What is the remedy available to the prosecution from the court's order granting Jaime's motion for new trial?\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nThe remedy of the prosecution is to file a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, because the denial of a motion for reconsideration is merely an interlocutory order and there is no plain, speedy and adequate remedy under the course of law. Be that as it may, it may be argued that appeal is the appropriate remedy from an order denying a motion for reconsideration of an order granting a motion for new trial because an order denying a motion for reconsideration was already removed in the enumeration of matters that cannot be a subject of an appeal under Section 1, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court.\n\n\nB) In what court and within what period should a remedy be availed of? SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nFollowing the principle of judicial hierarchy, the petition for certiorari should be filed before the Court of\nAppeals within sixty (60) days from receipt of the copy of the order of denial of the public prosecutor’s\nmotion for reconsideration, or on October 20, 2015.\n\nC) Who should pursue the remedy? SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nThe office of the Solicitor General should pursue the remedy. In criminal proceedings on appeal in the\nCourt of Appeals or in the Supreme Court, the authority to represent the people is vested solely in the Solicitor General. Under Presidential Decree No. 478, among the specific powers and functions of the OSG is to “represent the government in the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals in all criminal proceedings.” This provision has been carried over to the Revised Administrative Code particularly in Book IV, Title III, Chapter 12 thereof. Without doubt, the OSG is the appellate counsel of the People of the Philippines in all criminal cases (Cariño v. de Castro, G.R. No. 176084, April 30, 2008).\n\nM.

The general rule is that a search warrant must be served in the day time (Rule 126, Sec.8, Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure), or that portion of the twenty-four hours in which a man’s person and countenance are distinguishable (17 C.J. 1134). By way of exception, a search warrant may be made at night when it is positively asserted in the affidavit that the property is on the person or in the place ordered to be searched (Alvares vs. CFI of Tayabas, 64 Phil. 33). There is no showing that the exception applies.\n\nE) If I were the lawyer of Sio Pao and Ho Pia, I would file a Motion to Quash the search warrant for having been served beyond its period of validity.

(Rule 126, Sec.10, Revised Rules of Court).\n\nF) No, the court should not order the return of the unlicensed armalite because it is contraband or illegal per se. (PDEA vs. Brodett, G.R.

When the police served the warrant, they also sought the assistance of barangay tanods who were assigned to look at other portions of the premises around the house. In a nipa hut thirty (30) meters away from the house of Ass-asin, a Barangay tanod came upon a kilo of marijuana that was wrapped in newsprint. He took it and this was later used by the authorities to charge Ass-asin with illegal possession of marijuana. Ass-asin objected to the introduction of such evidence claiming that it was illegally seized. Is the objection of Ass-asin valid? (2014 BAR QUESTION)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nThe objection is valid. The search warrant specifically designates or describes the house as the place to be searched. Incidentally, the marijuana was seized by the Barangay Tanods thirty (30) meters away from the house of the accused. Since the confiscated items were found in a place other than the one described in the search warrant, it can be considered as fruits of an invalid warrantless search, the presentation of which as an evidence is a violation of petitioner’s constitutional guaranty against unreasonable searches and seizure (Ruben Del Castillo v. People of the Philippines, G.R. No. 185128, January 30, 2012). Besides, the search is also illegal because the marijuana confiscated in the nipa hut was wrapped in a newsprint. Therefore, the same cannot be considered validly seized in plain view (Abraham Miclat v. People of the Philippines, G.R. No. 176077, August 31, 2011).\n\n"

The search warrant authorized the seizure of “undetermined quantity of shabu.” During the service of the search warrant, the raiding team also recovered a kilo of dried marijuana leaves wrapped in newsprint. The accused moved to suppress the marijuana leaves as evidence for the violation of Section 11 of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 since they were not covered by the search warrant. The State justified the seizure of the marijuana leaves under the “plain view” doctrine. There was no indication of whether the marijuana leaves were discovered and seized before or after the seizure of the shabu. If you are the judge, how would you rule on the motion to suppress? (2008 BAR QUESTION)\n\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nThe motion to suppress filed by the accused should be granted. The search warrant violates the constitutional and statutory requirement that it should particularly describe the person or things to be seized (Sec. 2, Art. Ill, Constitution; Sec. 2, Rule 126, Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure). The “plain view” doctrine cannot be invoked because the marijuana leaves were wrapped in newsprint. Besides the marijuana leaves are not the subject of the search warrant. There was no evidence as to whether the marijuana leaves were discovered and seized before or after the seizure of the shabu. If they were discovered after the seizure of the shabu, then they could not have been seized in plain view (Cf. People vs. Musa, GR No. 96177, January\n27, 1997). The confiscation of the marijuana leaves must be upheld, (People v. Salunguit Roberto y Ko, 356\nSCRA 683 [200l]), hence rendering the same inadmissible in evidence against the accused.\n\n"

(2007 BAR QUESTION)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nYes, the police may take with him the “unlicensed” firearm although not covered by the search warrant. Possession of an “unlicensed firearm” is a criminal offense and the police officer may seize an article which is the “subject of an offense.” This is especially so considering that the “unlicensed firearm” appears to be in “plain view” of the police officer when he conducted the search.\n\nEven if the warrant was subsequently quashed, the police is not mandated to return the “unlicensed firearm.” The quashal of the search warrant did not affect the validity of the seizure of the “unlicensed firearm.” Moreover, returning the firearm to a person who is not otherwise allowed by law to possess the same would be tantamount to abetting a violation of the law.\n\nO.

After arraignment, the prosecution moved that X be preventively suspended. X opposed the motion arguing that he was now occupying a position different from that which the Information charged him and therefore, there is no more possibility that he can intimidate witnesses and hamper the prosecution. Decide. Suppose X files a Motion to Quash challenging the validity of the Information and the Sandiganbayan denies the same, will there still be a need to conduct a pre-suspension hearing? Explain. (2012 BAR QUESTION)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\n\nThere is no necessity for the court to conduct pre-suspension hearing. Under Section 13 of RA No. 3019, an incumbent public officer against whom any criminal prosecution under a valid information for graft- related crime such as malversation is pending in court, shall be suspended from office. The word “office”, from which the public officer charged shall be preventively suspended, could apply to any office, which he might currently be holding and not necessarily the particular office under which he was charged. The preventive suspension of the following public officers was sustained: (1) a mayor, who was charged with acts committed as a government auditor of the Commission on Audit (Bayot vs. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. L-61776 to L-61861, March 23, 1984); (2) a public officer, who was already occupying the office of governor and not the position of municipal mayor that he held previously when charged with having violated Anti- Graft Law (Deloso vs. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 86899, May 15, 1989); (3) a Vice Governor, whose suspension is predicated on his acts supposedly committed while still a member of the Sangguniang Bayan (Libanan vs. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 112386, June 14, 1994). Thus, the DENR undersecretary can be preventively suspended even though he was a mayor, when he allegedly committed malversation.\n\nSettled is the rule that where the accused files a motion to quash the information or challenges the validity thereof, a show cause order of the trial court would no longer be necessary. What is indispensable is that the trial court duly hear the parties at a hearing held for determining the validity of the information, and thereafter hand down its ruling, issuing the corresponding order of suspension should it uphold the validity of the information (Luciano vs. Mariano, G.R. No. L-32950, July 30, 1971). Since a pre-suspension hearing is basically a due process requirement, when an accused public official is given an adequate opportunity to be heard on his possible defenses against the mandatory suspension under RA No. 3019, then an accused would have no reason to complain that no actual hearing was conducted (Miguel vs. The Honorable Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 172035, July 4, 2012). In the facts given, the DENR Undersecretary was already given opportunity to question the validity of the Information for malversation by filing a motion to quash, and yet, the Sandiganbayan sustained its validity. There is no necessity for the court to conduct pre- suspension hearing to determine for the second time the validity of the information for purpose of preventively suspending the accused.\n\nALTERNATIVE ANSWER:\n\nThe argument that X should not be suspended as he now holds an office different from that charged in the information is unavailing. Under Section 13(e) of RA 3019, a public officer may be charged before the Sandiganbayan for “causing undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official, administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.” The Supreme Court has held that Section 13 of RA 3019 is so clear and explicit that there is hardly room for any extended court rationalization of the law. Preventive suspension is mandatory regardless of the respondent’s change in position.\n"

Thereafter,the guards opened the package and found two (2) kilograms of cocaine. The owner of the package was arrested and charges were filed against him. During the trial, the prosecution, through the trainer who was present during the incident and an expert in this kind of field, testified that the dog was highly trained to sniff packages to determine if the contents were dangerous drugs and the sniffing technique of their highly trained dogs was accepted worldwide and had been successful in dangerous drugs operations. The prosecution moved to admit this evidence to justify the opening of the package. The accused objected on the grounds that : (i) the guards had no personal knowledge of the contents of the package before it was opened; (ii) the testimony of the trainer of the dog is hearsay; and (iii) the accused could not cross-examine the dog. Decide. (2014BAR QUESTION) SUGGESTED ANSWER:The objections of the accused should be overruled. An evidence is admissible when it is relevant to the issue and is not excluded by the law or the rules (Section 3, Rule 128). Under Section 36, Rules 130 of the Rules of Court, a witness can testify only to those which he knows of his personal knowledge and derived from his own perception. The contention that the guards had no personal knowledge of the contents of the package before it was opened is without merit. The guards can testify as to the facts surround the opening of the package since they have personal knowledge of the circumstances thereof, being physically present at the time of its discovery.On the other hand, the testimony of the trainer of the dog is not hearsay based on the following grounds:a)   He has personal knowledge of the facts in issue, having witnessed the same;b)   Hearsay merely contemplates an out-of-court declaration of a person which is being offered to prove the truthfulness and veracity of the facts asserted therein;c)   He is an expert witness, hence, his testimony may constitute an exception to the hearsay rule;d)   The accused has the opportunity to cross-examine him; ande)   Testimony of a witness as to statements made by nonhuman declarants does not violate the ruleagainst hearsay. The law permits the so-called “non-human evidence” on the ground that machines and animals, unlike humans, lack a conscious motivation to tell falsehoods, and because the workings of machines can be explained by human witnesses who are then subject to cross- examination by opposing counsel. (City of Webster Groves v. Quick. 323 S.W. 2d 386 [Mo. 1959]; Buck v. State, 138 P. 2d 115 [Okla. 1943]; Herrera, 1999).Conversely, the accused may not argue that he cannot cross-examine the dog as the Constitutional right to confrontation refers only to witnesses. As alluded, the human witnesses who have explained the workings of the non-human evidence is the one that should be cross-examined. Hence, the contention of the accused that the he could not cross-examine the dog is misplaced. Ergo, there is no doubt that the evidence of the prosecution is admissible for being relevant and competent."

Dr. Carlos, Walter’s psychiatrist who lived near the burned house and whom Walter medically consulted after the fire, also saw Walter in the vicinity some minutes before  the  fire.  Coincidentally,  Fr.  Platino,  the  parish  priest  who  regularly  hears  Walter’sconfession and who heard it after the fire, also encountered him not too far away from the burned house.Walter was charged with arson and at his trial, the prosecution moved to introduce the testimonies of Nenita, the doctor and the priest-confessor, who all saw Walter at the vicinity of the fire at about the time of the fire.A)  May the testimony of Nenita be allowed over the objection of Walter? (2013 BAR QUESTION) SUGGESTED ANSWER:NO. Nenita may not be allowed to testify against Walter. Under the Marital Disqualification Rule, duringtheir marriage, neither the husband nor the wife may testify for or against the other without the consent of the affected spouse, except in a civil case by one against the other, or in a criminal case for a crime committed by one against the other or the latter's direct descendants or ascendants (Sec. 22, Rule 130). The foregoing exceptions cannot apply since it only extends to a criminal case of one spouse against the other or the latter’s direct ascendants or descendants. Clearly, Nenita is not the offended party and her sister is not her direct ascendant or descendant for her to fall within the exception.B) May the testimony of Dr. Carlos, Walter’s psychiatrist, be allowed over Walter’s objection? (2013BAR QUESTION) SUGGESTED ANSWER:YES. The testimony of Walter’s psychiatrist may be allowed. The privileged communication contemplated under Sec. 24 (c) Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence involves only persons authorized to practice medicine, surgery or obstetrics. It does not include a Psychiatrist. Moreover, the privileged communication applies only in civil cases and not in a criminal case for arson. Besides, the subject of the testimony of Dr. Carlos was not in connection with the advice or treatment given by him to Walter, or any information he acquired in attending to Walter in a professional capacity. The testimony of Dr. Carlos is limited only to what he perceived at the vicinity of the fire and at about the time of the fire.C) May the testimony of Fr. Platino, the priest-confessor, be allowed over Walter’s objection? (2013BAR  QUESTION) SUGGESTED ANSWER:YES. The Priest can testify over the objection of Walter. The disqualification requires that the same were made pursuant to a religious duty enjoined in the course of discipline of the sect or denomination to which they belong and must be confidential and penitential in character, e.g., under the seal of confession (Sec.24 (d) Rule 130).Here, the testimony of Fr. Platino was not previously subject of a confession of Walter or an advice given by him to Walter in his professional character. The testimony was merely limited to what Fr. Platino perceived “at the vicinity of the fire and at about the time of the fire.” Hence, Fr. Platino may be allowed to testify."

    "text": "9.   On March 12, 2008, Mabini was charged with Murder for fatally stabbing Emilio. To prove the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation, the prosecution introduced on December 11,2009 a text message, which Mabini's estranged wife Gregoria had sent to Emilio on the eve of his death, reading: `Honey, papatayin u ni Mabini. Mtgaln nyang plano i2. Mg ingat u bka ma tsugi k.` (2010 BAR QUESTION)A) A subpoena ad testificandum was served on Gregoria. For her to be presented for the purpose of identifying her cellphone and the text message. Mabini objected to her Presentation on the ground of marital privilege. Resolve.SUGGESTED ANSWER:The objection should be sustained on the ground of the marital disqualification rule (Rule 130, Sec. 22); not on the ground of the `marital privilege` communication rule. (Rule 130, Sec. 24). The marriage between Mabini and Gregoria is still subsisting and the situation at bar does not come under the exceptions to the disqualification by reason of marriage.B) Suppose Mabini's objection in question A was sustained. The prosecution thereupon announced that it would be presenting Emilio's wife Graciana to' identify Emilio's cellphone bearing Gregoria's text message. Mabini objected again. Rule on the objection.SUGGESTED ANSWER:The objection should  be overruled. The testimony of Graciana is not  covered  by the said  marital disqualification rule because she is not the wife of Mabini. Besides, Graciana will identify only the cellphone as that of her husband Emilio, not the messages therein which to her are hearsay.C) If Mabini's objection in question B was 'overruled, can he object to the presentation of the text message on the ground that it is hearsay?SUGGESTED ANSWER:No, Gregoria's text message in Emilio's cellphone is not covered by the hearsay rule because it is regarded in the rules of evidence as independently relevant statement: the text message is not to prove the truth of the fact alleged therein but only as to the circumstance of whether or not premeditation exists.D) Suppose that shortly before he expired, Emilio was able to send a text message to his wife Graciana reading `Nasaksak ako. Dna me makahinga. Si Mabini ang may gawa ni2.` Is this text message admissible as a dying declaration? Explain.SUGGESTED ANSWER:Yes, the text message is admissible as a dying declaration since the same came from the victim who shortly expired and it is in respect of the cause and circumstance of his death. The decisive factor that the message was made and sent under consciousness of an impending death, is evidently attendant from the victim's Statement: “D na me makahinga` and the fact that he died shortly after he sent the text message. However, cellphone messages are regarded as electronic evidence, and in a recent case (Ang v. Court of Appeals et al., GR No. 182835, April 20, 2010), the Supreme Court ruled that the Rules on Electronic Evidence applies only to civil actions, quasi-judicial proceedings and administrative proceeding, not to criminal actions.ALTERNATIVE ANSWER:No, the text message is not admissible as a dying declaration because it lacks indication that the victim was under consciousness of an impending death. The statement `D na me makahinga` is still equivocal in the text message sent that does not imply consciousness of forth-coming death."

The Information for rape filed against BB states:`On or about October 30, 2015, in the City of S.P. and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused, a minor, fifteen (15) years old with lewd design and by means of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously had sexual intercourse with AA, a minor, twelve (12) years old against the latter's will and consent.`At the trial, the prosecutor called to the witness stand AA as his first witness and manifested that he be allowed to ask leading questions in conducting his direct examination pursuant to the Rule on the Examination of a Child Witness. BB's counsel objected on the ground that the prosecutor has not conducted a competency examination on the witness, a requirement before the rule cited can be applied in the case. (2015 BAR QUESTIONS)A) Is BB's counsel correct? SUGGESTED ANSWER:No. BB’s counsel is not correct. Every child is presumed qualified to be a witness (Sec. 6, Rule onExamination of Child Witness [RECW]). To rebut the presumption of competence enjoyed by a child, the burden of proof lies on the party challenging his competence (Sec. 6 of A.M. No. 005-07-SC or the Rules on Examination of Child Witness). Here, AA, a 12-year old child witness who is presumed to be competent, may be asked leading questions by the prosecutor in conducting his direct examination pursuant to the RECW and the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure (People v. Santos, G.R. No. 171452, October 17, 2008).B) In order to obviate the counsel's argument on the competency of AA as prosecution witness, the judge motu proprio conducted his voir dire examination on AA. Was the action taken by the judge proper?SUGGESTED ANSWER:Yes,  the judge may  motu  proprio  conduct his  voir  dire  examination  on AA.  Under  the  Rules on Examination of Child Witness, the court shall conduct a competency examination of a child, motu proprio or on motion of a party, when it finds that substantial doubt exists regarding the ability of the child to perceive, remember, communicate, distinguish truth from falsehood, or appreciate the duty to tell the truth in court (Sec. 6 of A.M. No. 005-07-SC or the Rules on Examination of Child Witness).C) After the prosecution had rested its case, BB' s counsel filed with leave a demurrer to evidence, seeking the dismissal of the case on the ground that the prosecutor failed to present any evidence on BB' s minority as alleged in the Information. Should the court grant the demurrer?SUGGESTED ANSWER:No, the court should not grant the demurrer. While it was alleged in the information that BB was a minor at the time of the commission of the offense, the failure of the prosecutor to present evidence to prove his minority is not a basis for the granting of the demurrer, because minority of the accused is not an element of the crime of rape. Be that as it may, the Court should not consider minority in rendering the decision. After all, the failure of the prosecutor to prove the minority of AA may only affect the imposable penalty but may not absolve him from criminal liability."

He obtained a copy of the confidential psychiatric evaluation report on his wife from the secretary of the psychiatrist. Can he testify on the said report without offending the rule on privileged communication? Explain. (2016BAR QUESTION)SUGGESTED ANSWER:Yes. John can testify. Under the rule on privileged communication, the husband or the wife, during or after the marriage, cannot be examined without the consent of the other as to any communication received in confidence by one from the other during the marriage except in a civil case by one against the other, or in a criminal case for a crime committed by one against the other or the latter’s direct descendants or ascendants (Rule 130, Sec. 24 (a), Rules of Court). In this case, Anne cannot prevent john from testifying against her since the petition for declaration of nullity is a civil case filed by one spouse against the other; hence, the rule on privileged communication between the spouses does not apply, John could testify on the confidential psychiatric evaluation report of his wife that he obtained from the secretary of the psychiatrist, without offending the rule on privileged communication.ALTERNATIVE ANSWER:No. John cannot testify. A person authorized to practice medicine, surgery or obstetrics cannot in a civil case, without the consent of the patient, be examined as to any advice or treatment given by him or any information which he may have acquired in attending such patient in a professional capacity, which information was necessary to enable him to act in that capacity, and which would blacken the reputation of the patient (Section 24 (c), Rule 130, Rules on Evidence). Relative thereto, the Rule pertains only to the Physician authorized to practice medicine, surgery or obstetrics in a civil case who will testify without the consent of the patient. The husband can testify, therefore, on the copy of the psychiatric evaluation report on his wife that he obtained from the secretary of the psychiatrist. After all, the husband can testify because the marital disqualification rule does not apply in a civil case filed by one against the other (Section 22, Rule130, Rules on Evidence)."

It may be inferred that Venancio had consciousness of his impending death since he suffered gunshot wounds to his chest which would necessarily be mortal wounds.However, Venancio’s statement that it was Arnulfo who shot Vicente is not admissible as a dying declaration since it did not relate to the cause of the declarant’s death but to the death of another person."

The heirs of the five (5) victims filed an action for damages against SPS.Plaintiff’s counsel sent written interrogatories to Ely, asking whether statements of witnesses were obtained; if written, copies were to be furnished; if oral, the exact provisions were to be set forth in detail. Ely refused to comply, arguing that the documents and information asked are privileged communication. Is the contention tenable? Explain. (2008 BAR QUESTION)SUGGESTED ANSWER:Yes, the contention of counsel for SPS is tenable considering that he was acting in his professional capacity in bringing about the statement he obtained from witnesses and the memoranda he made. The notes, memoranda, and writings made by counsel in pursuance of his professional duty, form part of his private and confidential files in the cases handled by him; hence privileged (Air Philippines Corp. v. Pennswell, Inc.,540 SCRA 215 [2007]).ALTERNATIVE ANSWER:The oral statements secured by the lawyer from the witnesses may not be the subject of discovery procedure not because they are privileged communication but because of the danger of untruthfulness and inaccuracy. The account of the lawyer is likewise hearsay evidence. Besides, plaintiff’s counsel may obtain transcripts of the testimonies of the four survivors before the maritime board inquiry.On the other hand, under Rule 23, the lawyer may be examined regarding the existence of the written statements of the survivors, including the description, nature, and custody thereof, not being privileged communication.

Judicial admission is not covered by the Rule on vicarious admissions considered as exceptions to the Res Inter Alios Acta Rule. Under the Res Inter Alios Acta Rule, the rights of a party cannot be prejudiced by the act, declaration or omission of another (Section 38, Rule 130, Rules of Court).

The exceptions are admission by a co-partner or agent (Section 29); admission by conspirator (Section 30); admission byprivies; (Section 31); which are collectively classified by Senator Salonga as “vicarious admissions”.

PO2 Asintado hid himself behind the bushes and saw a man beating a woman whom he recognized as his neighbour, Kulasa. When Kulasa was already in agony the man stabbed her and she fell on the ground. The man hurriedly left thereafter. PO2Asintado immediately went to Kulasa’s rescue. Kulasa who was then in a state of hysteria, keptmentioning to PO2 Asintado “Si Rene, gusto akong patayin! Sinaksak niya ako!” When PO2Asintado was about to carry her, Kulasa refused and said “Kaya ko. Mababaw lang to. Habulin mo si Rene.” The following day, Rene learned of Kulasa’s death and, bothered by his conscience, surrendered to the authorities with his counsel. As his surrender was broadcasted all over media, Rene opted to release his statement to the press which goes:“I believe that I am entitled to the presumption of innocence until my guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt. Although I admit that I performed acts that may take one’s life away, I hope and pray that justice will be served in the right way. God bless us all.(Sgd.) Rene”The trial court convicted Rene of homicide on the basis of PO2 Asintado’s testimony, Kulasa’s statements, and Rene’s statement to the press. On appeal, Rene raises the following errors:A) The trial court erred in giving weight to PO2 Asintado’s testimony, as the latter did not havepersonal knowledge of the facts in issue, and violated Rene’s right to due process when itconsidered Kulasa’s statements despite lack of opportunity for her cross-examination. (2014 BAR QUESTION)SUGGESTED ANSWER:The trial court did not err in giving weight to PO2 Asintado’s testimony.While a witness can only testify as to those facts which he has personal knowledge of, the Rules provide that a statement made under the influence of a startling event witnessed by the person who made the declaration before he had time to think and make up a story, or to concoct or contrive a falsehood, or to fabricate an account, and without any undue influence in obtaining it, aside from referring to the event in question or its immediate attending circumstances, is an exception being part of res gestae. In the case, the statements made by PO2 Asintado constitutes part of res gestae since the same were made without any opportunity to fabricate and while a startling occurrence was actually taking place.In addition, the statement of PO2 Asintado may fall within the purview of the doctrine of independent relevant statement, where only the fact that such statements were made is relevant, and the truth and falsity thereof is immaterial (People v. Malibiran, G.R. No. 178301, April 24, 2009).On the other hand, Kulasa’s statements are also admissible as part of res gestae since the same were madeunder the influence of a startling event and without any opportunity to concoct or devise a falsehood.B) The trial court erred in holding that Rene’s statement to the press was a confession which, standing alone, would be sufficient to warrant a conviction. Resolve. (2014 BAR QUESTION)SUGGESTED ANSWER:The trial court did not err in holding that Rene’s statement to the press is a confession. Rene’s confessions to the media were properly admitted because statements spontaneously made by a suspect to news reporters on a televised interview are deemed voluntary and are admissible in evidence (People v.

[S11 R132] The reputation must only be on character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. [Cordial v. People,166 SCRA 17]Here the evidence is not on the Prosecution witness’s general reputation for honesty, truth, or integrity but on his aggressive and violent tendencies. The evidence had nothing to do with the witness’s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. Hence the impeachment was improper.H.   Judicial Affidavit Rule (A.M. No. 12-8-8-SC)"

    "text": "31.   Pedro was charged with theft for stealing Juan's cellphone worth P20,000.00. Prosecutor Marilag at the pre-trial submitted the judicial affidavit of Juan attaching the receipt for the purchase of the cellphone to prove civil liability. She also submitted the judicial affidavit of Mario, an eyewitness who narrated therein how Pedro stole Juan's cellphone.At the trial, Pedro's lawyer objected to the prosecution's use of judicial affidavits of her witnesses considering the imposable penalty on the offense with which his client was charged. (2015 BAR QUESTION)A) Is Pedro's lawyer correct in objecting to the judicial affidavit of Mario? SUGGESTED ANSWER:Yes, Pedro’s lawyer is correct in objecting to the judicial affidavit of Mario. The Judicial Affidavit Rules shall apply only to criminal actions where the maximum of the imposable penalty does not exceed six years (Section 9 (a) (1) of A.M. No. 12-8-8-SC or the Judicial Affidavit Rule). Here, the maximum impossible penalty for the crime of theft of a cell phone worth P20,000.00 is prision mayor in its minimum to medium periods, or six years and one day to eight years and one day. Thus, Pedro’s lawyer is correct in objecting to the judicial affidavit of Mario.[Note: The Committee respectfully recommends that the examinees be given full credit to any answer given to the question, because the specific imposable penalties for crimes or offenses charged are not included in the 2015 BAR Examination Syllabus in Remedial Law.]B) Is Pedro's lawyer correct in objecting to the judicial affidavit of Juan? SUGGESTED ANSWER:No, Pedro’s lawyer is not correct in objecting to the judicial affidavit of Juan because the Judicial AffidavitRules apply with respect to the civil aspect of the actions, regardless of the penalties involved (Section 9 of A.M. No. 12-8-8-SC or the Judicial Affidavit Rule). Here, the judicial affidavit of Juan was offered to prove the civil liability of Pedro. Thus, the objection of Pedro’s lawyer to the judicial affidavit of Juan is not correct.C) At the conclusion of the prosecution's presentation of evidence, Prosecutor Marilag orally offered the receipt attached to Juan's judicial affidavit, which the court admitted over the objection of Pedro's lawyer.After Pedro's presentation of his evidence, the court rendered judgment finding him guilty as charged and holding him civilly liable for P20,000.00.Pedro's lawyer seasonably filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision asserting that the court erred in awarding the civil liability on the basis of Juan's judicial affidavit, a documentary evidence which Prosecutor Marilag failed to orally offer. Is the motion for reconsideration meritorious?SUGGESTED ANSWER:No. The motion for reconsideration is not meritorious. The judicial affidavit is not required to be orally offered as separate documentary evidence, because it is filed in lieu of the direct testimony of the witness. It is offered, at the time the witness is called to testify, and any objection to it should have been made at the time the witness was presented (Sections 6 and 8, A.M. No. 12-8-8-SC or the Judicial Affidavit Rule). Since the receipt attached to the judicial affidavit was orally offered, there was enough basis for the court to award civil liability."

    "text": "36.  Discuss the `chain of custody` principle with respect to evidence seized under R.A. 9165 or theComprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. (2012 BAR QUESTION) SUGGESTED ANSWER:In prosecutions involving narcotics and other illegal substances, the substance itself constitutes part of the corpus delicti of the offense and the fact of its existence is vital to sustain a judgment of conviction beyond reasonable doubt. The chain of custody requirement is essential to ensure that doubts regarding the identity of the evidence are removed through the monitoring and tracking of the movements of the seized drugs from the accused, to the police, to the forensic chemist, and finally to the court. (People vs. Sitco, G.R. No. 178202, May 14, 2010, Velasco, Jr. J.). Ergo, the existence of the dangerous drug is a condition sine qua non for conviction. (People vs. De Guzman Y Danzil, G.R. No. 186498, March 26, 2010 Nachura J.). The failure to establish, through convincing proof, that the integrity of the seized items has been adequately preserved through an unbroken chain of custody is enough to engender reasonable doubt on the guilt of an accused (People vs. De Guzman Y Danzil). Nonetheless, non-compliance with the procedure shall not render void and invalid the seizure and custody of the drugs when: (1) such non-compliance is attended by justifiable grounds; and (2) the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending team. There must be proof that these two (2) requirements were met before such noncompliance may be said to fall within the scope of the proviso. (People vs. Dela Cruz, G.R. No. 177222, October 29, 2008, 570 SCRA 273).ALTERNATIVE ANSWER:Crucial in proving chain of custody is the marking of the seized drugs or other related items immediately after they are seized from the accused. Marking after seizure is the starting point in the custodial link, thus, it is vital that the seized contraband are immediately marked because succeeding handlers of the specimens will use the markings as reference. Thus, non-compliance by the apprehending/buy-bust team with Sec.21 of R.A. 9165 is not fatal as long as there is justifiable ground therefor, and as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the confiscated/seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team. (People vs. Mantalaba, G.R. No. 186227, July 20, 2011). (N.B.: The case of People v. Romy Lim, G.R. No.231989, 4 September 2018 be considered)IX. WRIT OF AMPARO (A.M. No. 07-9-12-SC)"

    "text": "39.  The residents of Mt. Ahohoy, headed by Masigasig, formed a nongovernmental organization - Alyansa Laban sa Minahan sa Ahohoy (ALMA) to protest the mining operations of Oro Negro Mining in the mountain. ALMA members picketed daily at the entrance of the mining site blocking the ingress and egress of trucks and equipment of Oro Negro, hampering its operations. Masigasig had an altercation with Mapusok arising from the complaint of the mining engineer of Oro Negro that one of their trucks was destroyed by ALMA members. Mapusok is the leader of the Association of Peace Keepers of Ahohoy (APKA), a civilian volunteer organization serving as auxiliary force of the local police to maintain peace and order in the area. Subsequently, Masigasig disappeared. Mayumi, the wife of Masigasig, and the members of ALMA searched for Masigasig, but all their efforts proved futile. Mapagmatyag, a member of ALMA, learned from Maingay, a member of APKA, during their binge drinking that Masigasig was abducted by other members of APKA, on order of Mapusok. Mayumi and ALMA sought the assistance of the local police to search for Masigasig, but they refused to extend their cooperation.Immediately, Mayumi filed with the RTC, a petition for the issuance of the writ of amparo against Mapusok and APKA. ALMA also filed a petition for the issuance of the writ of amparo with the Court of Appeals against Mapusok and APKA. Respondents Mapusok and APKA, in their Return filed with the RTC, raised among their defenses that they are not agents of the State; hence, cannot be impleaded as respondents in an amparo petition. (2015 BAR QUESTION)A) Is their defense tenable? SUGGESTED ANSWER:No. The defense is not tenable. The writ of amparo is a remedy available to any person whose right to life,liberty and security has been violated or is threatened with violation by an unlawful act or omission of a public officer or employee or of a private individual or entity. The writ covers extralegal killing and enforced disappearances or threats thereof (Section 1, Rules on the Writ of Amparo). Moreover, the rules do not require that the respondents should be agents of the State in order to be impleaded as respondents in an amparo petition (Secretary of National Defense v. Manalo, G.R. No. 180906, October 7, 2008).B) Respondents Mapusok and APKA, in their Return filed with the Court of Appeals, raised as their defense that the petition should be dismissed on the ground that ALMA cannot file the petition because of the earlier petition filed by Mayumi with the RTC. Are respondents correct in raising their defense?SUGGESTED ANSWER:Yes. The respondents are correct in raising the defense. Under Section 2(c) of the Rules on the Writ of Amparo, the filing of a petition by Mayumi who is an immediate member of the family of the aggrieved party already suspends the right of all other authorized parties to file similar petitions. Hence, ALMA cannot file the petition because of the earlier petition filed by Mayumi with the RTC.C) Mayumi later filed separate criminal and civil actions against Mapusok. How will the cases affect the amparo petition she earlier filed?SUGGESTED ANSWER:When a criminal action and a separate civil action are filed subsequent to a petition for a writ of amparo, the latter shall be consolidated with the criminal action. After consolidation, the procedure under the Rules shall continue to apply to the disposition of the reliefs in the petition (Sec. 23, Rule on the Writ of Amparo).X.   WRIT OF HABEAS DATA (A.M.

Cruz, Marinduque. ABC used highly toxic chemicals in extracting gold. ABC's toxic mine tailings were accidentally released from its storage dams and were discharged into the rivers of said town. The mine tailings found their way to Calancan Bay and allegedly to the waters of nearby Romblon and Quezon. The damage to the crops and loss of earnings were estimated at Pl Billion. Damage to the environment is estimated at Pl Billion. As lawyer for the organization, you are requested to explain the advantages derived from a  petition for writ of kalikasan before the Supreme Court over a complaint for damages before the RTC of Marinduque or vice-versa. What action will you recommend? Explain. (2016 BAR QUESTION)SUGGESTED ANSWER:The following reliefs may be included under the writ of kalikasan: (a) Directing respondent to permanently cease and desist from committing acts or neglecting the performance of a duty in violation of environmental laws resulting in environmental destruction or damage; (b) Directing the respondent public official, government agency, private person or entity to protect, preserve, rehabilitate or restore the environment; (c) Directing the respondent public official, government agency, private person or entity to monitor strict compliance with the decision and orders of the court; (d) Directing the respondent public official, government agency, or private person or entity to make periodic reports on the execution of the final judgment; and (e) Such other reliefs which relate to the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology or to the protection, preservation, rehabilitation or restoration of the environment, except the award of damages to individual petitioner (Sec. 15, Rule 7. Ibid).The rules also provide interim reliefs in favor of the petitioner upon filing a verified motion, namely: (i) Ocular inspection; or (ii) Production or inspection of documents or things (Sec. 12, Rule 7, A.M. No. 09-6-8-SC also known as Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases).Additionally, the petition for Writ of Kalikasan is more advantageous compared to a complaint for damages before the RTC because it may be filed directly with the Supreme Court or with any of the stations of the Court of Appeals. Unlike a complaint for damages before the RTC which can only be filed by a real-party- in-interest as defined in Rule 3(2) of the Rules of Court, the rule on locus standi is relaxed in petitions for Writ of Kalikasan which allows the petition to be filed by parties as a citizen suit. In addition, any of the following may file a petition for Writ of Kalikasan: (a) natural or juridical person; (b) entity authorized by law; or (c) POs, NGOs or any public interest group accredited by or registered with any government agency on behalf of persons whose constitutional right to a balanced and healthful ecology is violated (Sec. 1, Rule7, A.M. No. 09-6-8-SC). Besides, the petition for Writ of Kalikasan is exempted from the payment of docket fees.From the foregoing, it is clear that filing a petition for Writ of Kalikasan would be the best remedy to address all the environmental problems caused by the release of the toxic waste to the waters of Romblon and Quezon without the burden of paying docket fees. After all, the filing of a petition for the issuance of the Writ of Kalikasan shall not preclude the filing of separate civil, criminal or administrative actions; thus, the organization can later file a complaint for damages with the Regional Trial Court, should they desire to do so. At any rate, the rules provide that judgment must be rendered within sixty (60) days from the time the petition is submitted for decision which expedites the proceedings significantly considering the urgency of the situation in the instant case. As lawyer for the organization I would recommend, therefore, the filing of a petition for a Writ of Kalikasan with the Supreme Court.D. Others"
